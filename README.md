# KIRA-PLASTININA-UNSUPERVISED-ML-PROJECT-WITH-R
This repository contains two notebooks. One contains my analysis and ML model that is meant to predict who is most likely to click on an ad related to a cryptography course. The other notebook contains analysis and an unsupervised learning model built for a personal project. Both projects are not done for real clients

## Description
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups. They have asked me to use my expertise as a Data Scientist to build a model to help the learn these caharacteristics.

My hypothetical client has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process
My main task was to analyze who is most likely to click on an ad related to a cryptography course based
on certain factors including gender, time spent on the blog site, daily internet usage, , age, country among others. I was also tasked to build a supervised ML model with R to make predictions on who is most likely to click on the ads.
